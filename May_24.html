										<p>Bob Peabody, our trusty treasurer for a solid 27-year stretch, has decided to hang up his cap. And Larry Soto, another key player, is planning to putt away from the club. It’s like finding ourselves in the rough and needing a couple of solid swings to get back on the fairway.</p>

										<p>Stepping up as Treasurer isn't just about keeping the scorecard straight; it’s about ensuring our club’s financials are as tidy as a freshly raked sand trap. And taking over Larry's role? Well, that's like being the one to set up tee times for our tournaments—absolutely crucial for keeping the game in full swing!</p>
											
										<p>We need some club champions to step up and drive forward, ensuring the SOGC doesn’t turn into an abandoned clubhouse. Remember, in golf and in our club, it’s all about teamwork and chipping in where we can. So, who’s ready to take a swing at these roles? Let’s keep our club as lively as a hole-in-one celebration!</p>

										<p><strong>It is imperative that you arrive no later than 30 minutes prior to the first tee time. Failure to do so causes significant inconvenience for those responsible for collecting money and checking people in, as they are unable to warm up. Additionally, arriving early will not only alleviate this issue but also enable you to play better.</strong></p>

										<p><strong>2023/2024 Match Play Round Two Results:</strong>
											<p>In today's only match, we had a real showdown between King and Soto. Senan King came out of the gates swinging, snagging a 2-up lead after just 4 holes. But Larry Soto wasn’t about to let that slide. He rallied like a seasoned pro and took control, flipping the script to a 2-up lead by the 10th hole.</p>

												<p>But just when it seemed like Larry had it in the bag, Senan pulled off a spectacular comeback. He went on a tear, winning 5 of the next 6 holes, leaving Larry in the dust. Senan cruised to a comfortable 3 & 2 victory, sealing the match with style.</p>

                                                <img src="2024/May/KingSoto.png" alt="Match Play" width="100%" />

												<p>With this impressive win, Senan King will now tee off against Dave Dorr in the upcoming round. That promises to be a real test of nerves and skill!</p>

												<p>Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for the match between Dave Dimmick and Rafael Torres to wrap up. Once they finish their duel on the greens, we’ll know who else advances.</p>

											<p><strong>3 Putts:</strong> It looks like everyone had a bit of a putting challenge out there except for two smooth operators. Rafael Torres and Joe Morse managed to avoid the dreaded three-putt</p>
											<p><strong>Chip Ins:</strong> Two players managed to pull off the elusive chip-ins today. John Wei delivered a beauty on hole 4, while Jesse Alaniz showed his short game magic on hole 15.</p>
											<p><strong>How Did We Do?</strong> The 7th hole was our collective sweet spot, where we averaged just 0.5 over par. With a course stroke index of 17, it's no wonder we found it a bit friendlier—like a welcoming fairway on a sunny day.</p>

											<p>On the flip side, hole 9 proved to be our toughest test, with an average of 1.7 shots over par. Given its stroke index of 1, it’s the course’s most challenging hole, and it certainly lived up to its reputation.</p>
											<p><strong>Low Gross:</strong> Joe Morse really showed his class in the latest round, carding the low gross with a stellar 81.</p>
