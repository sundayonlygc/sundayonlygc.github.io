										<h2 class="major">Individual Play</h2>
											<p> <strong>CPs:</strong> Ted Escobar (#7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry Soto (#11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonio Villa (#13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave Dimmick (#17)</p>

											<p><strong>Low Putts:</strong> Quincy Virgilio (23)</p>
											<p><strong>High Putts:</strong> Larry Soto, Senan King, Norm Koenig, Ben Wu (34)</p>
										<h2 class="major">Highlights</h2>
										<p><strong>Birdie Shooters:</strong> 8 out of 12 players got at lest one birdie on this fine day: Edgar Alaniz (2,3,18)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quincy Virgilio (17)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonio Villa (3,17)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave Dimmick (6,14,17)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ted Escobar (7,8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Reyes (2,6,7,8,18)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senan King (18)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Wu (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
											<p><strong>3 Putts:</strong> In the realm of the greens, where the dreaded 3 putts haunted many, Dave Dimmick emerged as the unwavering maestro, the sole player to defy the three-putt specter with his flawless precision.</p>
											<p><strong>Chip Ins:</strong> On this spectacular day, the fairways bore witness to extraordinary feats, as Antonio Villa, on the first hole, Edgar Alaniz, on the second, and Quincy Virgilio, on the sixth, weaved magic with their clubs, seamlessly chipping in their shots, leaving an indelible mark of brilliance on the course.</p>
											<p><strong>How Did We Do?</strong> As a collective force, we navigated the course with a blend of finesse and determination. Hole 17, with its gentle charms, proved to be our sanctuary, as we averaged a flawless performance at par. However, on the challenging terrain of the 12th hole, we faced a formidable adversary, collectively shooting 1.4 strokes over par, a testament to our unyielding spirit in the face of adversity. Together, we forged a memorable journey through the greens, marked by both triumph and tenacity.</p>
											<p><strong>Low Gross:</strong> In the pursuit of low gross supremacy, it was Edgar Alaniz and Ted Escobar who exhibited their mettle, both carding an impressive 74, a mere two strokes over par. Their harmonious blend of skill and strategy showcased a level of play that left us all in awe, and in this competitive landscape, they stood shoulder to shoulder as paragon performers.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Skins</h2>
										<p>It was a thrilling day at Coyote Creek, where the golfing prowess of our players led to some incredible skin-winning performances. Dave Dimmick's remarkable achievement of three net eagles showcased his skill, with the 9th and 14th holes yielding him well-deserved skins. Edgar's spectacular net albatross on the 2nd hole added to the day's excitement.</p>

										<p>Ray Gilcrest and Larry Soto displayed their finesse, clinching skins with net birdies on the 11th and 12th holes, respectively. Quincy Virgilio, with a net eagle on the 17th hole, claimed the final skin of the day.</p>
											
										<p>However, it's worth noting that Senan King and Edgar Alaniz's net eagles on the 18th hole canceled each other out, leaving the field with a suspenseful outcome.</p>
											
										<p>With each skin valued at $9, these golfers not only displayed their talent but also took home a piece of the day's well-earned rewards.</p>
