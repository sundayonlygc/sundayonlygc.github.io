										<p>Bob Peabody, our trusty treasurer for a solid 27-year stretch, has decided to hang up his cap. And Larry Soto, another key player, is planning to putt away from the club. It’s like finding ourselves in the rough and needing a couple of solid swings to get back on the fairway.</p>

										<p>Stepping up as Treasurer isn't just about keeping the scorecard straight; it’s about ensuring our club’s financials are as tidy as a freshly raked sand trap. And taking over Larry's role? Well, that's like being the one to set up tee times for our tournaments—absolutely crucial for keeping the game in full swing!</p>
											
										<p>We need some club champions to step up and drive forward, ensuring the SOGC doesn’t turn into an abandoned clubhouse. Remember, in golf and in our club, it’s all about teamwork and chipping in where we can. So, who’s ready to take a swing at these roles? Let’s keep our club as lively as a hole-in-one celebration!</p>

										<p><strong>It is imperative that you arrive no later than 30 minutes prior to the first tee time. Failure to do so causes significant inconvenience for those responsible for collecting money and checking people in, as they are unable to warm up. Additionally, arriving early will not only alleviate this issue but also enable you to play better.</strong></p>

											<p>Dave Dimmick and Rafael Torres battled it out in a closely contested match. Rafael started strong, but Dave turned up the heat on the back nine, securing a victory with a solid 4-up finish. With this victory, Dimmick now faces off against Joe Morse.</p>

Dave rallied like a pro, taking control on the back nine and finishing with a convincing 2-up lead. Dave Dorr will now face the winner of the Dimmick vs. Morse match.</p>

											<p><strong>3 Putts:</strong> Senan King was swinging smooth like a pro! Avoiding the dreaded three-putt is like sinking a birdie on the 18th to win the tournament—nothing short of impressive. It’s all about that silky touch on the greens, reading the breaks just right, and having the nerves of steel. Kudos to Senan for keeping it clean on the putting surface while others were navigating the greens like they were dodging bunkers. Now that’s what I call a putting clinic!</p>
											<p><strong>Chip Ins:</strong> Looks like Mark Reyes pulled a rabbit out of the hat on hole 5 with that chip-in! That’s the kind of shot that brings a smile to any golfer’s face and a roar from the gallery.</p>
											<p><strong>How Did We Do?</strong> Hole 9 really played the villain out there, didn’t it? With an average of 2.3 strokes over par</p>

											<p>On the flip side, hole 13 was the friendly neighbor, serving up birdie opportunities like appetizers at the clubhouse.</p>
											<p><strong>Low Gross:</strong> Joe Morse really showed his class in the latest round, carding the low gross with a stellar 79.</p>

											<p>John Roberts matched that feat on #8.</p>
											<p>Mark Reyes deserves a special shoutout for the only gross par on the beastly #9, where the club's average gross was a whopping 7.25. That’s some steady play, Mark!</p>
