										<p><strong>It is imperative that you arrive no later than 30 minutes prior to the first tee time. Failure to do so causes significant inconvenience for those responsible for collecting money and checking people in, as they are unable to warm up. Additionally, arriving early will not only alleviate this issue but also enable you to play better.</strong></p>

										<p><strong>Final 2023 Match Play Results:</strong>
											Congratulations to Dave Dorr, who emerged as the champion of our 2023 Match Play competition! Dave's outstanding performance in this year's matches led him to victory, marking his first Match Play Championship since 1999. Well done, Dave!
											</p>
											<p>
											<strong>Tournament Disruptions:</strong>
											Unfortunately, we faced some disruptions this year due to bad weather, causing us to miss two tournaments. Additionally, we had to disqualify 11 players for missing at least two tournaments in a row. While these decisions are never easy, they are in line with our club's rules and regulations.
											</p>
											<p>
											<strong>Looking Ahead to 2024:</strong>
											As we close the chapter on the 2023 season, we're already gearing up for an exciting 2024 campaign. Our plans include hosting matches in December, right before our November tournament. Stay tuned for more details and updates as we prepare for another year of thrilling golfing experiences.</p>
